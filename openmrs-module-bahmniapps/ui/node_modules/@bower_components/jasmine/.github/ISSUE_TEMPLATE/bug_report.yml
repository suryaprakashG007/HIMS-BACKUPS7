        Thanks for taking the time to report a bug. Please follow these steps first.

        ## Troubleshooting
        Please take the time to rule out issues with your code or third party libraries before filing a bug report. If you are reporting an error, try to determine whether the error is coming from Jasmine, another library, or your own code.

        Check the [FAQ](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html) and any other relevant [documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html) to see if your issue has already been addressed.

        ## Special troubleshooting steps for asynchronous scenarios
        If the issue has to do with testing asynchronous code, please read the [async tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/async) and the [async section of the FAQ](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html#async). In particular, check for the following common errors:

        * Are you trying to write a synchronous test for asynchronous code?
        * Does the test signal completion before the code under test finishes?
        * Do expectations run before the code that they're trying to verify?

        ## Try the latest version of Jasmine
        If at all possible, upgrade to the latest versions of `jasmine-core` and any other relevant packages (e.g. `jasmine`, `jasmine-browser-runner`). If you can't do that, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/tree/main/release_notes) for all newer versions to make sure that the bug hasn't already been fixed.

        ## Explain how to reproduce the bug
        
        **Working steps to reproduce are required for all bug reports.** Please help us help you by creating complete but minimal instructions for reproducing the bug.
        
        The steps to reproduce could be:
        
        * A code snippet that reproduces the problem when run by itself in a newly generated empty `jasmine` or `jasmine-browser-runner` project, or in the standalone distribution.
        * A set of steps that reproduce the problem when followed exactly as they're written in an empty directory.
        * A link to a Git repository or zip/tar file containing a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). This option is required for all bugs that can only be reproduced with third-party libraries, including Angular and Karma.

        Please **test your steps** by starting with an empty directory and following them exactly as they're written. Bug reports with steps to reproduce that are unclear, don't work, or include an unreasonable amount of extraneous code will likely be closed.
