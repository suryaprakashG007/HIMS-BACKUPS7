# Jasmine Core 5.4.0 Release Notes

## Changes

* Fixed de-duplication of exception messages containing blank lines on Node and Chrome

  This is particularly helpful when reporting testing-library errors, which
  have messages that contain blank lines and can be hundreds or even thousands
  of lines long.

* Document that the expected and actual properties of expectation results are deprecated

  The values of these properties are not reliable in configurations where 
  reporter messages are JSON serialized. They appear to have been seldom if ever 
  used. They will be removed in the next major release. 

* Added Firefox 128 (current ESR) to supported browsers

## Supported environments

This version has been tested in the following environments.

| Environment       | Supported versions      |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Node              | 18, 20, 22              |
| Safari            | 15-17                   |
| Chrome            | 129*                    |
| Firefox           | 102**, 115**, 128, 131* |
| Edge              | 129*                    |

\* Evergreen browser. Each version of Jasmine is tested against the latest
version available at release time.<br>
\** Environments that are past end of life are supported on a best-effort basis.
They may be dropped in a future minor release of Jasmine if continued support
becomes impractical.
