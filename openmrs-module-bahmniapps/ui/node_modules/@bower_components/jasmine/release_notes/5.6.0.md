## Documentation updates

* Demoted Safari to best-effort support
  
  Due to limited availability of Safari versions for contributors and maintainers
  as well as in CI, Safari will be supported on the same best-effort basis as
  environments that are past end of life, such as previous Firefox ESR versions. 
  See [this discussion](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/discussions/2050) for
  more information about why this change was made and what to expect.


## Supported environments

This version has been tested in the following environments.

| Environment       | Supported versions      |

\* Evergreen browser. Each version of Jasmine is tested against the latest
version available at release time.<br>
\** Supported on a best-effort basis. Support for these versions may be dropped
if it becomes impractical, and bugs affecting only these versions may not be
treated as release blockers.
