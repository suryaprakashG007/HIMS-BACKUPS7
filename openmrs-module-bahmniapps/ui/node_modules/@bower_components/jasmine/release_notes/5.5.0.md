# Jasmine Core 5.5.0 Release Notes

## Changes

* Optionally enforce uniqueness of spec and suite names

  This is off by default for backwards compatibility but can be enabled
  by setting the `forbidDuplicateNames` env config property to true.
  Fixes [#1633](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1633).

* Include property value mismatches in diffs even when there are missing or 
  extra properties

## Supported environments

This version has been tested in the following environments.

| Environment       | Supported versions      |

\* Evergreen browser. Each version of Jasmine is tested against the latest

They may be dropped in a future minor release of Jasmine if continued support
becomes impractical.
