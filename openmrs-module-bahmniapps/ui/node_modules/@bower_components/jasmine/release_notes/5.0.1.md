# Jasmine Core 5.0.1 Release Notes

## Changes

* Optionally restore the pre-5.0 behavior of boot() always creating a new instance

  This is needed by jasmine-npm (and likely other tools like it) that may
  need to create and use multiple envs in sequence.

## Supported environments

jasmine-core 5.0.1 has been tested in the following environments.

| Environment       | Supported versions |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Node              | 18, 20             |
| Safari            | 15-16              |
| Chrome            | 114                |
| Firefox           | 102, 113           |
