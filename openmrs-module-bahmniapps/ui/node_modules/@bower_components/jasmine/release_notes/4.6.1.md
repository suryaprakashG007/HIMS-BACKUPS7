# Jasmine Core 4.6.1 Release Notes

## Summary

This is a one-time backport of bug fixes from 5.x, for the benefit of Karma
users who may not be aware that they're still using 4.x.

No further 4.x releases are planned. If possible, you should upgrade to the
latest 5.x instead of 4.6.1. If you're using Karma, you can do this by 
installing jasmine-core 5.x and adding an override to package.json:

```
{
    // ...
    "overrides": {
        "karma-jasmine": {
            "jasmine-core": "^5.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```
