# Jasmine Core 5.7.0 Release Notes

## New features

* Added [Clock#autoTick](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.7/Clock.html#autoTick)
  to automatically tick the clock asynchronously
  * Merges #2042 from @atscott and @stephenfarrar
  * Fixes #1725

* Expose [spec path](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.7/Spec.html#getPath) as an
  array of names in addition to the existing concatenated name

  This is meant to support tools like IDE integrations that need to filter a run
  to an exact set of suites/specs.


## Documentation improvements

* Documented that [SpecResult#filename](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.7/global.html#SpecResult)
  and [SuiteResult#filename](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.7/global.html#SuiteResult)
  are wrong when zone.js is present and in some cases where it/describe/etc are
  replaced
* Updated docs for expected and actual properties of 
[expectation results](https://jasmine.github.io/api/5.7/global.html#ExpectationResult)


## Internal improvements

* Rewrote the build system to not use Grunt

  Although Grunt has served Jasmine well over the years, it was keeping us tied
  to an aging and increasingly questionable set of dev dependencies.

* Updated to eslint 9
* Removed mostly-unmaintained dev dependency 'temp'
* Updated most other dev dependencies to latest versions
* Fixed sass deprecation warning
* Updated to Sauce Connect 5
* Made stop-sauce-connect script more robust

if it becomes impractical, and bugs affecting only these versions may not be
treated as release blockers.
